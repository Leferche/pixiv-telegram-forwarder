# Usage
1. Enable the installed script.

3. The "Send to telegram" button on the image will send only the image on which it is located.
4. The button that is located after all the images "Send everything to telegram" - will send all the images in this work. (If there is more than one image in the work, that is, there is a "Show all" button, then you first need to click it.)
5. The displayed buttons often have a lot of problems, however, there is a "fix" button on the bottom left. Click on it in case of errors :) .
